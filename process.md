> How will you communicate with teammates you depend on? 

We will be primarily using Facebook Messenger for text messages and Discord for audio and video chatting. We chose Facebook
Messenger because everyone checks it multiple times per day already, and we chose Discord because it has consistent audio
and video quality. 

> What coordination and planning practices will you follow? 

We will be having check-ins weekly on Saturdays at 2 pm, because everyone in the group is free on Saturdays at 2 pm. If additional
communication is needed, we will message in either the Facebook Messenger group or the Discord group and set up a chat for
another time slot. We have already talked about what times we are available to meet.

> Who will own each of the components in your architecture? 

James will be taking ownership of the Alarm Storage and the Alarm Display. He has had the most development experience, so we are
giving him two components to take ownership of. Additionally, they are related components, so it will make it easier to coordinate
processes because he owns both. Additionally, James has special experience with databases from INFO 442 and his internship 
last summer. 
Emily will be taking ownership of the Alarm Manager component because it is connected with all of the other components and 
she is willing to coordinate with every member of the team. 
Maddie is taking ownership of the Google Maps component because she has had experience with the 
Google Maps API from an Android development class and is interested in working with Maps. Joy is taking ownership of the 
Notification Manager and Google Places components because she also has experience with the Google APIs and has had 
experience with notifications in Android from her Android development class. 

> By what date will you have a release candidate? 

We will have a release candidate by three days before the due date. 

> What practices will you use to know if you're making progress toward that release candidate?

We will be checking commit history daily on GitHub to make sure that people are doing their work. We have implemented automatic alerts in our Discord channel so everyone gets a notification when someone pushes to GitHub. We will be doing unit testing on all of our functions and also doing integration testing. 

> What practices will you follow to improve your process if it's not working?

If our process is not working, we will convene as a group over Discord or in person to talk about how we can improve our
process and get our work done in time to meet the deadline. If one or more group members is not available to chat about the 
deadline, we will reschedule the meeting or fill them in about the new process.
