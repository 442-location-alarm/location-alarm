> How will you communicate with teammates you depend on? 

We will be primarily using Facebook Messenger for text messages and Discord for audio and video chatting. We chose Facebook
Messenger because everyone checks it multiple times per day already, and we chose Discord because it has consistent audio
and video quality. 

> What coordination and planning practices will you follow? 

We will be having check-ins weekly on Saturdays at 2 pm, because everyone in the group is free on Saturdays at 2 pm. If additional
communication is needed, we will message in either the Facebook Messenger group or the Discord group and set up a chat for
another time slot. We have already talked about what times we are available to meet.

> Who will own each of the components in your architecture? 

James will be taking ownership of the Alarm Storage and the Alarm Display. He has had the most development experience, so we are
giving him two components to take ownership of. Additionally, they are related components, so it will make it easier to coordinate
processes because he owns both. Additionally, James has special experience with databases from INFO 442 and his internship 
last summer. 
Emily will be taking ownership of the Alarm Manager
