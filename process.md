# Team Process

> How will you communicate with teammates you depend on?

We will be using Facebook Messenger for text messaging and Discord for audio and video chatting. We chose Facebook Messenger because everyone checks it multiple times per day already, and we chose Discord because it has consistent audio and video quality.

> What coordination and planning practices will you follow?

We will be having check-ins weekly on Saturdays at 2 PM over Discord because everybody is free at that time. We will conduct these check-ins Agile-style with each person sharing what they worked on the past week, what they will work on in the coming week, and any blockers. We are choosing Agile-style since it gives everyone insight into what the other people are working on and provides the possibility to work with someone else if having issues. If additional communication is needed, we will set up further meetings over Facebook Messenger.

> Who will own each of the components in your architecture?

### AlarmStore and AlarmList
James will be taking ownership of AlarmStore and AlarmList. He has had the most development experience, so we are giving him two components to take ownership of. Furthermore, the two components are related (AlarmList is created by AlarmStore), so it will make it easier to coordinate processes. Additionally, James has experience with databases from INFO 442 and his internship last summer, meaning he will be able to complete the AlarmStore quickly.

### Alarm
Emily will be taking ownership of the Alarm component because it is connected with all of the other components and she is willing to coordinate with every member of the team. Joy will implement the enable and disable functions for Alarm since those two functions involve sending/removing notifications and she has experience with that.

### GoogleMaps and GooglePlaces
Maddie is taking ownership of the GoogleMaps and GooglePlaces components because she has had experience with the Google Maps API from an Android development class and is interested in taking it further to implement our location alarm.

> By what date will you have a release candidate?

We will have a release candidate by June 7th (three days before the due date). We want to finish our project a little early so that we can do some preliminary testing for bugs and make any last-minute changes.

> What practices will you use to know if you're making progress toward that release candidate?

We will be checking commit history daily on GitHub to make sure that people are doing their work. We have implemented automatic alerts in our Discord channel so everyone gets a notification when someone pushes to GitHub. We will be doing unit testing on all of our functions and also doing integration testing.

> What practices will you follow to improve your process if it's not working?

If our process is not working, we will convene as a group over Discord or in person to talk about how we can improve our
process and get our work done in time to meet the deadline. If one or more group members is not available to chat about the
deadline, we will reschedule the meeting or fill them in about the new process.
