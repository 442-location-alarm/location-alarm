# Location Alarm Specification

## The Problem
Alarm-Me is a mobile application used to notify the user when they reach a certain location. It is used often by those on public transportation so that they do not miss their stops. This application is necessary because time-based alarm systems can be rendered ineffective by unexpected delays. However, Alarm-Me offers an unsatisfying user experience due to poor design, a low level of intuitiveness, and the continuous intrusion of advertisements.

We came up with the above three problems with the Alarm-Me user experience through three avenues of investigation: ratings in the Google Play Store, observation of INFO 442 classmates using the application, and scholarly papers on sentiment of mobile users towards ads.

As of 4/13/2019 at 12:30PM, Alarm-Me holds a 4.2 out of 5 rating from 632 user reviews. Most five star reviews state that the application works as expected, but some note that the process of setting an alarm is “unnecessarily complicated”<sup>[1]</sup> and many contain suggestions to improve functionality. 10 one star reviews detailed interruption of advertisements as a major concern.

In our personal observation of classmates using Alarm-Me, we noted that many faced issues with the interface. Problems included confusion between making an alarm and selecting a location, inability to cancel an alarm, and concerns with the clarity of application icons and the relative size/spacing of those icons<sup>[2]</sup>.

A 2018 report found that consumers tend to accept ads in a free application. However, this sentiment does not extend to full page ads, especially if there is no ‘X’ button to quickly exit<sup>[3]</sup>. Alarm-Me is an offender for full page ads, which greatly reduces the odds that a user will continue using it.
