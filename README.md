# Location Alarm

## Mission Statement
We want to provide fully free (including ads!), high-quality alternatives to paid mobile applications.

## Problem Statement
Alarm Me is a mobile application used to wake the user when they get near a certain location. Currently, the app is full of ads. These are annoying, intrusive, and they interrupt the user experience by slowing down the application and interfering with the overall design. All of these together make it more likely for a user to stop using the app. Less people using the app means more people having a hard time determining when they have reached locations of interest.
